Have you ever joined a small Telegram group to keep each other accountable in LeetCoding (and on other platforms like HackerRank), only to slowly get tired of manually keeping track of the questions you did?

Or did you ever encounter a situation where you have to scroll through tons of question lists in order to identify questions that your mock interview partner has yet to do?
